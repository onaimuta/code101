    Dynamos Football Club was formed in 1963 in Mbare, Salisbury, Rhodesia. The Club was formed at the height of the Rhodesia Front’s racist onslaught which had seen sport being divided along racial lines.
    Dynamos was an offshoot of two semi-professional clubs namely Salisbury United and Salisbury City who had disbanded in 1962. The disbanding of the two teams, who boasted some of the best football talents in the then Rhodesia National League, saw the birth of the club whose name was inspired by the old Dynamos Moscow Football Club of old Russia then.
    The original team of 1963 which blended the “cream de la cream” of football in Salisbury‘s black community boasted of players who were entertainers par excellence.
