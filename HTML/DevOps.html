<h4>Planning and Coding Phase: New features and Code is build</p>
    <p>Build Phase: Simple intergration and Unit tests and code is build</p>
        <p>Testing Phase: Testing to discover unforseen bugs</p>
            <p>Release and Deployment Phase: Code is released and deployed to environments</p>
